# event-manager
Event Manager project - from The Odin Project curriculum.

This is a project that will be making use of the GoogleCivic API, and it will
be the first time that I work with an API and with files and serialization.
CSV files will be used to get the data needed for the project, and it is also
my first time learning about them.
